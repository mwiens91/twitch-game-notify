# twitch-game-notify

This is a Twitch notifier which notifies you when your favourite
steamers play your favourite games. Officially, Ubuntu >= 16.04 is
supported, but other Linux distros and possibly even Mac OSs may also
work (contact me if you have it running on another distro or OSâ€”I'm
curious).

With normal settings, this will send notifications to your existing
notification handler when a streamer is playing a game you've specified:

You'll also get a tray icon so you can easily quit the application:

## Installation

We'll need to install a few dependencies first. I'll assume you're on
Ubuntu.

To get the dependencies needed for D-Bus notifications and for
displaying an icon in the system tray, run

```
sudo apt install libdbus-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev \
                 libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev
```

If you want to install twitch-game-notify globally on your machine (cf.
running from source directly from
[run_twitchgamenotify.py](run_twitchgamenotify.py)), install it using
pip with

```
sudo pip3 install twitch-game-notify
```

Running the above command with root isn't strictly necessary, but it'll
put the `twitch-game-notify` binary on your `$PATH`, which is nice.

## Configuration

Configuration files look like the following:

```yaml
query-period: 5
twitch-api-client-id: "p0gch4mp101fy451do9uod1s1x9i4a"
twitch-api-client-secret: "itqb0thqi5cek18ae6ekm7pbqvh63k"
streamers:
  "macie_jay":     # Macie_Jay
    include:
      - "460630"   # notify my when Macie plays Rainbow Six: Siege
  "moonmoon_ow":   # MOONMOON_OW
    include:
      - "*"        # notify me when Moon plays any game
    exclude:
      - "33214"    # except for Fortnite
```

There's a `query-period`, which specifies how often the main loop
happens for querying the streamers you've specified (in seconds).
There's a `twitch-api-client-id` and `twitch-api-client-secret`, which
we'll get to in a second. Then there's a list of streamers, which for
each you specify what games you want to be notified about.

### Setting up a configuration file

twitch-game-notify looks for a configuration file at two paths:

1. `$PROJECT_ROOT/config.yaml`
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/twitch-game-notify/config.yaml`

where `$PROJECT_ROOT` is the base of the twitch-game-notify project
(which you generally only want to use if you're running from source),
and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` defaults to `$HOME/.config`, if you don't have it
defined.

To get started, either copy the example configuration file
[config.yaml.example](config.yaml.example) to one of the above locations
(making sure to rename it to `config.yaml`) or run

```
twitch-game-notify --print-config > $DEST/config.yaml
```

which downloads the example configuration file from GitHub and prints it
to the terminal, which you can then redirect to a file.

### Getting a Twitch API client ID and client secret

To get a Twitch client ID and client secret, you need to either create
or link an existing Twitch account with [Twitch's dev
portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/). Up to date instructions for obtaining a
client ID and client secret can be found at
[dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/).

### Constructing the streamers list

The streamers list has a bunch of streamer login names. For example,
[MOONMOON_OW](https://www.twitch.tv/moonmoon_ow)'s login name is
moonmoon_ow, which can be easily found from his stream's URL:

```
https://www.twitch.tv/moonmoon_ow
```

For each streamer you can include games you want to be notified about.
For example,

```yaml
streamers:
  "macie_jay":     # Macie_Jay
    include:
      - "460630"   # notify my when Macie plays Rainbow Six: Siege
```

where 460630 is the game ID for Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege.

If you want to be notified when a streamer plays any game you can use
`"*"`. For example,

```yaml
streamers:
  "moonmoon_ow":   # MOONMOON_OW
    include:
      - "*"        # notify me when Moon plays any game
```

If you want to be notified about every game *except* specific games, you
can also specify an `exclude` section along with `"*"`. For example,

```yaml
streamers:
  "moonmoon_ow":   # MOONMOON_OW
    include:
      - "*"        # notify me when Moon plays any game
    exclude:
      - "33214"    # except for Fortnite
```

where 33214 is the game ID for Fortnite.

You can find out what the game ID for a given game is by querying the
Twitch API directly (see [their
reference](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-games) for
how). For convenience, a list of popular games' IDs are listed in the
example configuration file [config.yaml.example](config.yaml.example):

```yaml
# 7 Days to Die: 271304
# Always On: 499973
# Arena of Valor: 498302
# ARK: 489635
# Art: 509660
# Artifact: 16937
# ASMR: 509659
# Battlefield V: 504199
# Black Desert Online: 386821
# Blade and Soul: 20423
# ...
```

## Usage

Run twitch-game-notify with

```
twitch-game-notify
```

or directly with [run_twitchgamenotify.py](run_twitchgamenotify.py):

```
./run_twitchgamenotify.py
```

For a list of everything you can do with twitch-game-notify, run

```
twitch-game-notify --help
```

## Rate limits

The Twitch API allows for 120 API queries per minute. When you first
start up twitch-game-notify, you're going to be using up to 3 API
queries per streamer you've specified. When you've been running
twitch-game-notify for awhile, most of the static API data will be
cached and you're going be using ~1 API query per streamer.

As a rough estimate, if you have `N` streamers on your list, you're
going to want to have a `query-period` of a little above `N / 2`
seconds.
