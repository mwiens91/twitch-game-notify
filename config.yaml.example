# Ignore 502 "Bad Gateway" errors: these are going to occur somewhat
# randomly and don't necessarily mean anything is wrong. For "one-shot"
# usage you probably want to know when one of these occurs, so you'll
# know if your information is correct; for persistant usage, since the
# 502 errors are somewhat random, if one occurs, you'll likely get the
# information you want on the next cycle. I recommend that you leave
# these settings as is unless you're debugging a connectivity problem or
# some other issues.
